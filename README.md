# OOP
1. Inheritance : Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class.
Inheritance is the methodology of using properties and methods of an already existing class in a new class. The existing class is the parent or superclass while the new class is the child or subclass. The developer does not have to write the code from the beginning. Instead, he can use the already existing code and develop the rest. Therefore, inheritance allows code reusability.

2. polymorphism: The polymorphism is a core concept of an object-oriented paradigm that provides a way to perform a single action in different forms. It provides an ability to call the same method on different JavaScript objects.

3. Abstraction: Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming   that "shows" only essential attributes and "hides" unnecessary information. The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users.It helps in reducing programming complexity and efforts.

4. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and the methods that act on that data such that access to that data is restricted from outside the bundle.that means that an object stores its state privately, and only the objectâ€™s methods have access to change it.We can use _ or # before the property name in the class. that means its private.
